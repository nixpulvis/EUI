# Branching Plan

We will be following a very common branching scheme, as illustrated below. This is to help keep major changes isolated from other changes. The main idea is, there will be a working branch. This will be where _non_ feature changes are made. Then for every major feature we will make a new branch for it, and merge it when we feel it's ready.
