# EUI _formerly EpicUI_

A World of Warcraft User Interface, written by Nathan Lilienthal (Epicgrim). For more info, or to get in touch with me you can leave me comments here or over on the [Tukui forums](http://www.tukui.org/forums/forum.php?id=168). 

Feedback and bug reports are greatly appreciated. If you would like to help with this project there are a few things you could do. The first thing would be to fork this project and send pull requests, however if you want to be more involved let me know, I'd love to have more help :)

Inspired by [Tukui](http://www.tukui.org).

## Features
This UI is all about minimalism, without sacrifice. As a hardcore WoW player myself I know very well what a competitive player needs and doesn't need. This means your UI will be full featured and yet compact and lightweight.
