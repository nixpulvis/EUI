        <p>A World of Warcraft User Interface, written by Nathan Lilienthal (Epicgrim). For more info, or to get in touch with me you can leave me comments here or over on the <a href="http://www.tukui.org/forums/forum.php?id=168">Tukui forums</a>. </p>

<p>Feedback and bug reports are greatly appreciated. If you would like to help with this project there are a few things you could do. The first thing would be to fork this project and send pull requests, however if you want to be more involved let me know, I'd love to have more help :)</p>

<p>Inspired by <a href="http://www.tukui.org">Tukui</a>.</p>

<hr><h2>Features</h2>

<p>This UI is all about minimalism, without sacrifice. As a hardcore WoW player myself I know very well what a competitive player needs and doesn't need. This means your UI will be full featured and yet compact and lightweight.</p>

<h3>Combat Control</h3>

<h3>Item Control</h3>

<h3>Alerts</h3>

<h3>Customization</h3>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>The easiest way to get the latest stable version of EUI is to goto <a href="http://epicgrim.github.com/EUI">epicgrim.github.com/EUI</a> and click "Download Version X.X"
Alternatively you can view and download all versions of EUI from the <a href="https://github.com/Epicgrim/EUI/downloads">downloads tab</a> on Github. </p>

<p>If you want you can also <a href="https://github.com/Epicgrim/EUI/zipball/master">download the git repository</a> and use that. This has it's advantages and disadvantages. With this method you will have the absolute newest version I have committed, which means for you the newest features and bug fixes. It also means however that I have not tested it to my full liking, and it may have more issues then you would like. The choice is yours.</p>

<h2>Support</h2>

<p>If you have a github account or can take the few seconds it takes to make one, submitted issues on github are my preferred method of reporting bugs. However, there is also a forum open for Bugs on tukui.org <strong>NOTE TO SELF: Make Forum When version 1.0 is released</strong></p>
